### My responsibility in Photo-Scan Group:
•	Build 3D models for scanned pictures with Agisoft PhotoScan   
•	Prepared manual for end-users on using Agisoft PhotoScan to build 3D model for stumps  
•	Tested the influences of different imaging qualities on 3D modeling   
•	Inspired by GPS and found an innovative and effective theory to calculate the minimum scanned pictures required for 3D modeling  

### My Accomplishments:  
1. User Manual :
